The `examples` suite, comprising packages:

* `examples`: Yet another package for typesetting linguistic examples.

* `fancyitem`: This package allows the user to redefine the stock |\item|.  It
  also provides an end-of-item hook.

* `flexref`: This package allows the author to extract parts of the cross-reference.

This suite is a work in progress.  Anything may change without prior
notice.

Comments and ideas are more than welcome!
